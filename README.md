# BlackoutHybrid

BlackoutHybrid is the native Android wrapper for the GhostTech Blackout ecosystem.  
It provides a minimal, hardened interface layer that communicates with the private
Blackout Wallet Engine and future GhostTech modules.

This repository contains **only the Android shell**.  
It does **not** include the internal Blackout engine, cryptographic routines, or
classified execution boundaries.
