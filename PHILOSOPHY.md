# GhostTech Philosophy
Public Summary — Non‑Classified

GhostTech is built on a disciplined, adversarial, and intentional worldview.
The architecture reflects a belief in minimalism, determinism, and absolute
control over execution boundaries.

This document outlines the public-safe version of that philosophy.

---

# 1. Adversarial Mindset

GhostTech assumes:
- Attackers are persistent
- Networks are hostile
- Devices may be compromised
- No external system is trustworthy

Security is not a feature — it is the architecture.

---

# 2. Minimalism as Defense

GhostTech avoids:
- Bloat
- Telemetry
- Analytics
- Hidden dependencies
- Remote trust anchors

Less surface area means fewer attack vectors.

---

# 3. Determinism Over Convenience

GhostTech prioritizes:
- Predictable behavior
- Deterministic teardown
- Zero-retention memory
- Local-only execution

Convenience is never allowed to compromise security.

---

# 4. Private-by-Design

The most sensitive components:
- Never leave the Owner’s control
- Are never open-sourced
- Are never exposed to third parties

Transparency is not a requirement for trust.

---

# 5. Respect for the User

GhostTech does not:
- Track users
- Collect data
- Phone home
- Sell analytics
- Store keys

The user’s device is the only authority.
