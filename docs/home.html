# 🛡️ BlackGhost Wallet – Crypto Security, Reinvented

**BlackGhost** is a smart contract-based crypto wallet concept built for **true ownership, anonymity, and logic-based asset protection**. It’s a wallet designed by someone who knows **how wallets fail** — and how to stop it.

---

## 🔐 Features (Planned)

- Smart contract wallet core (Solidity-based)
- Auto-self-locking fail-safes
- Integrated 2FA logic (no email required)
- Gas-optimized deploy and recovery paths
- Self-destruct & ghost transfer mechanisms

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Language: Solidity
- IDE: Remix + Hardhat
- Network: Ethereum (Base support possible)
- Concept: DAO-secure logic chain

---

## 🎯 Why BlackGhost?

Because most wallets rely on **one key**, **one moment**, and **no second chances**. BlackGhost introduces:
- Multi-checkpoint logic before funds are moved
- Ghost wallets that trigger auto-actions
- Hard stops if abnormal behavior is detected

Designed by someone who:
- Learned crypto from zero
- Reverse-engineered common security flaws
- Thinks in attack vectors, not just balances
